**so_long** is a 2D game project developed as part of the **42 School** curriculum. The objective is to create a simple game where the player navigates through a map, collects items, and reaches an exit, all while avoiding obstacles. This project emphasizes understanding of graphics programming, file parsing, and algorithmic problem-solving using the **MiniLibX** graphics library.

## Project Overview

The **so_long** project is a top-down 2D game where the player must navigate through a maze-like map to collect items and reach the exit. The game is developed using the **MiniLibX** graphics library, which provides functions for creating windows, handling user input, and rendering images.

The project aims to strengthen skills in:

- **C programming**
- **Graphics rendering**
- **File I/O**
- **Algorithm design**
- **Memory management**

## Features

- **Player Movement:** Navigate the player using the arrow keys or WASD.
- **Collectibles:** Gather items to increase score.
- **Exit Mechanism:** Reach the exit to complete the level.
- **Collision Detection:** Prevent movement through walls.
- **Move Counter:** Display the number of moves made.
- **Victory Condition:** Trigger a win upon collecting all items and reaching the exit.
- **Error Handling:** Provide feedback for invalid maps or operations.
